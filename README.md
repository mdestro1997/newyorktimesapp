This project is a simple spring boot application applying some retail site buissness conditiona which as the following

1)If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount. <br />
2)If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount.<br />
3)If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.<br />
4)For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount).<br />
5)The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.<br />
6)A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.<br />
