This project is a simple spring boot application applying some retail site buissness conditiona which as the following

If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount).
The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.
A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.
